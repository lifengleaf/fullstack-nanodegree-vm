Tournament Planner
=============

This is the final project for [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197) on Udacity.

It uses PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament with the Swiss system. In Swiss system, players are not eliminated, and each player are paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it. The main changes are in fullstack-nanodegree-vm/vagrant/tournament/.

Getting started guide can be found on [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IgOm4XprTaKxAa8w02y028oBECOoB1EI1ReddADEeY/pub?embedded=true).
